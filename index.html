This model was built in Python during the practicals of "Programming for Geographical Information Analysis:Core Skills" 
course at the University of Leeds.It is an Agent Based Model which reads some environmental data and builds some agents by downloading data from the web.
It also makes these agents to move and interact with their environment and with each other. The result is 
an animation displayed through a GUI.
